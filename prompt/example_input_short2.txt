(57) ABSTRACT

Apparatus, methods, and articles of manufacture or dis-
closed for implementing risk scoring systems used for
vulnerability mitigation in a distributed computing environ-
ment, In one disclosed example, a computer-implemented
method of mitigating vulnerabilities within a computing
environment includes producing a risk score indicating at
least one of: a Vulnerability component, a security conﬁgu-
ration component, or a ﬁle integrity component for an object
within the computing environment, producing a signal score
indicating a factor that contributes to risk for the object, and
combining the risk score and the signal score to produce a
combined risk score indicating a risk level associated with at
least one vulnerability of the computing system object. In
some examples, the method further includes mitigating the
at least one vulnerability by changing a state of a computing
object using the combined risk score.
